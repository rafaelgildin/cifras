C       
I can show you the world
         Am         G
Shining, shimmering splendid
          Dm          Am
Tell me, princess, now when did
          F           C
You last let your heart decide?

C     
I can open your eyes
         Am         G
Take you wonder by wonder
         Dm         Am
Over sideways and under
     F     C
On a magic carpet ride

             G C
A whole new world
         G      E7       Am
A new fantastic point of view
         C        F
No one to tell us no
     C       F
Or where to go
    Am        G
Or say we're only dreaming

             G C
A whole new world
         G       E7        Am
A dazzling place I never   knew
C          F         
But when I'm way up here
      C      F
It's crystal clear
     Am           G                    C
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)

G            C
Unbelievable sights
G             Am
Indescribable feeling
G        Am        Dm
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
F                  C
Through an endless diamond sky

             G C
A whole new world
          G        C        Am
A hundred thousand things to see
           C        F
I'm like a shooting star
     C       F
I've come so far
Am          G         F            C
I can't go back to where I used to be

             G C
A whole new world   (Every turn a surprise)
         G           Am
With new horizons to pursue  (Every moment, red-letter)
        C       F
I'll chase them anywhere
        C       F
There's time to spare
       Am         G                    C
Let me share this whole new world with you

             G C
A whole new world    (A whole new world)
             G C                              
That's where we'll be  (That's where we'll be)
             G
A thrilling chase
             C
A wondrous place
    Am  G   C
For you and me
